### Attaching features

Lamione provides the ability to attach functions to features from code when calling the logger.
If feature is missing, it will be automatically created. Also, if the function is not attached to the feature, they will be linked.
\
\
In this example, after calling `logEvent`, "Login Button Click" function and "Authorization" feature will be created.

```js
const { logEvent } = useBrowserLamion({ ... });
logEvent("Login button click", "Authorization");
```

#### Using features with loggers

```js
const { useLogger } = useBrowserLamion({ ... });
const buttonLogger = useLogger("Login button click", "Authorization");
```

```js
buttonLogger.log();
```
