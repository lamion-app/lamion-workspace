# Static loggers

Logger is a utility that allows you to simplify logging of similar events in several places in a project.

---

To create a logger, call `useLogger` imported from the library.

```js
const { useLogger } = useBrowserLamion({ ... });
const buttonLogger = useLogger("Button click");
```

Next, create log by:

```js
buttonLogger.log();
```

> Keep in mind that `buttonLogger.log()` is alias to `logEvent('Button click')`
