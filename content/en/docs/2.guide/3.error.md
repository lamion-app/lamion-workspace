# Error handling

---

Error handling is important utility to detect bugs and crashes.
Lamion provides functionality to record exception.

```js
const { recordError } = useBrowserLamion({ ... });

try {
  // Code that may throw an exception
} catch (e) {
  recordError(e);
}
```

You also can link error to function (for example, to find problem functions)

```js
try {
  // Code that may throw an exception
} catch (e) {
  recordError(e, "Function name");
}
```
